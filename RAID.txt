* RAID, Redundant Array of Independent Disks, use a collection of hard drives to increase data reliability, and improve the performance. 
* Different RAID levels have different performance and reliability. 
* JBOD:
  >> Just a Bunch Of Drives.
  >> Mostly all the physical disks are just concatenated and presented as a single disk.

* RAID 0:
  >> no redundancy.
  >> data will broken into fragments called blocks, the number of blocks is dictated by the stripe size.
  >> stripe size is how many drives consist of.
  >> The blocks are written to their respective drives simultaneously on the same sector.
  >> Size = N X min(S1, S2,...Sn)
  
* RAID 1:
  >> mirroring.
  >> data is written identically to multiple drives, thereby producing a "mirrored set".
  >> at least 2 drives are required.
  >> The array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.
  >> write performance may be reduce.
  >> Size = min(S1, S2,...Sn)
  
* RAID 2:
  >> Bit-level striping.
  >> Expensive parity cost.
  >> Use Hamming-code to process data before wrtie.
  >> at least 3 drives are required.(depend on Hamming-code level)
  
* RAID 3:
  >> byte-level stripe.
  >> Use XOR to replace Hamming ECC, it's a easier way to generate parity, make performance better than RAID 2.
  >> Performance is slower for random, small I/O operations, because RAID 3 need to refer every disk on each read/write.

* RAID 4:
  >> block-level stripe.
  >> Most same as RAID 3, but in block level.
  >> random, small I/O operations still poor, but better than RAID 3.

* RAID 5:
  >> block-level striping with distributed parity.
  >> block-level Stripe.
  >> parity write to distributed disk everytime.
  >> only 1 extra disk is required.
  >> random, small I/O operations still poor, but better than RAID 3/4.
  >> Good aggregate transfer rate.
  
* RAID 6:
  >> block-level striping with double distributed parity.
  >> provides fault tolerance of two drive failures, because 
  >> Controller overhead to compute parity addresses is extremely high
  >> random, small I/O operations still poor, but better than RAID 3/4.

* Read-modify-write: 
  >> RAID 5, 6 need to read all blocks of data when every write, it will encounter Read-modify-write situation, it could be a performance issue.
